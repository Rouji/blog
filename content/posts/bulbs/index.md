Found some old light bulbs in our old house.

Like one of those fancy new LED bulbs with the cool twirly LED filament.  
Except not LED and not new.  
Uses about 170W as well. Pretty bright!

Look mum, no LEDs!

Wonder if they were hand-wound or something.

I don't know what this is. Glows really dimly, uses about 4W.  
This is actually two filaments(?), each only glowing on one half of the sine wave.  
I don't think the mirror finish is a feature. Looks more like sputtering.  
Weird.

What a weird bulb. There's no glass or nothing. Filament looks kinda long too.

Oh never mind, it's a 800W resistive heater you can directly lick the wire of if you want to.

As far as I can tell, this really quite heavy thing is just a transformer, so you can plug in tiny, very low-power bulbs and save some electricity.  
Not much light when off.

Not much when on either.

Big old bulb.

Very *very* bright for an incandescent. Clips my camera no matter what I do.

Turns out it's for photography.  
It's not a flash - you plug it into the mains like any other bulb - but its express purpose is for taking photos.

No wonder it's that bright, it eats 500W.  

I googled around a bit, and people are still selling them on ebay and stuff, so they're not very rare.  
Someone on a forum mentioned they have an average lifespan of around **7 hours**. Sheesh.
