If you buy [cheap extension tubes](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B015PBEH9S/) and the inner part looks shiny like this

You're gonna have a bad time with stray internal reflections making your pictures murky

So do yourself a favour and also grab some self-adhesive felty stuff

And take pictures like this instead

That is all.
